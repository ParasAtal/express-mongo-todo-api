# Todo Backend App

A simple Todo backend application built with Express.js and MongoDB, using Mongoose for database interaction.

## Overview

This backend application provides RESTful APIs for managing Todo items. Currently, it supports creating Todo items using the POST HTTP request. The data is stored in a MongoDB database, and Mongoose is used as the ODM (Object Data Modeling) library.

## Technologies Used

- **Express.js:** A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database for storing and retrieving data.
- **Mongoose:** An ODM library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a straightforward schema-based solution.
- **MongoDB Compass:** An official graphical user interface (GUI) for MongoDB, used for visualizing and interacting with the MongoDB database.
- **Postman:** A tool for testing APIs by making HTTP requests, used here for sending POST requests.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine
- MongoDB installed locally or accessible online
- MongoDB Compass GUI installed (optional, for visualizing the MongoDB database)
- Postman for testing API endpoints
